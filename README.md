# CarFerry
CarFerry is my university project for course named Concurrent Programming. Framework used: .NET 5.0

## The task
Cars appear on both sides of a river with an intention of crossing it (getting to the other side). To do that, they have to use a ferry. 
There are a few rules about the ferry courses. The ferry starts its travel in one of the following cases occur:
- the ferry fills entirely;
- on the opposite side of the river, there are enough cars, to fill the ferry entirely;
- the ferry has exceeded its patience limit.

Also, cars have to enter and leave the ferry one by one.
